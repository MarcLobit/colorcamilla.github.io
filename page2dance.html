        to introducing hip-hop dance outside the United States. Since being exposed,
        educational opportunities and dance competitions have helped maintain its presence worldwide.
        Europe hosts several international hip-hop competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships,
        Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia hosts a team-based competition called World
        Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum.</small>

        </picture><br><small>What distinguishes hip-hop from other forms of dance is that
        it is often "freestyle" (improvisational) in nature and hip-hop dance crews
        often engage in freestyle dance competitionsâ€”colloquially referred to as "battles".
        Crews, freestyling, and battles are identifiers of this style. Hip-hop dance can
        be a form of entertainment or a hobby. It can also be a way to stay active in
        competitive dance and a way to make a living by dancing professionally.</small>
